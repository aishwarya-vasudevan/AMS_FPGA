Abstract
********

Within this Electrical Engineering Project (EEP) **AMS-FPGA** in the master program MScEE at the School of Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science at Hochschule Bremen - City University of Applied Sciences selected FPGA boards will be
evaluated for analog/mixed-signal data processing. It is of interest, whether those FPGA's are applicable as DSP blocks,
e.g. decimation (CIC comb filter and half-band filter), inside a Sigma-Delta loop for educational purposes.
