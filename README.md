Analog/Mixed-Signal Circuit Design with FPGA's<br>
ABSTRACT<br>
This project for a collaborative EEP details the implementation of digital part sigma delta modulator i.e, decimation filter on DE0 Nano FPGA board using Quartus II Programmer. Digital Decimation process plays an important task in communication system. It mostly is applied in transceiver when the frequency reduction is required. The main work of this project is to design a filter (SINC3, half-band-filter (HBF) and droop-correction (DC)) for decimation.
